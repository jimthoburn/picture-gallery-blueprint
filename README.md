# Picture Gallery Blueprint _beta_

This is example code for automatically setting up a web site using [Deno](https://deno.land), [Git](https://git-scm.com) and [Docker](https://www.docker.com).

It‚Äôs a work in progress üöß

You can use the included [blueprint](https://render.com/docs/infrastructure-as-code) to host this on [Render](https://render.com/).

This works together with a separate [content repository](https://github.com/jimthoburn/picture-gallery) that has tools for building the web site.

The basic steps to get it working are:

1. [Use this template](https://github.com/jimthoburn/picture-gallery-blueprint/generate) to generate a copy of this repository and do the same for the [content repository](https://github.com/jimthoburn/picture-gallery). You may want to make them both private. üîê
2. Consider editing the included Dockerfile and [render.yaml](render.yaml) file. For example, you can change the region from `oregon` to one that‚Äôs closer to you. Another thing to consider is the [disk size](https://render.com/docs/disks).
3. Create a new GitHub account that only has access to your copy of the [content repository](https://github.com/jimthoburn/picture-gallery).
4. Generate a new [SSH key](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh) and add it to your new GitHub account.
5. In your Render dashboard, create a new environment group, following the ‚Äúpicture-gallery-settings‚Äù example in: https://github.com/jimthoburn/picture-gallery-blueprint/blob/main/render.yaml. For `GIT_REPOSITORY`, enter a value like `username/repository.git`, with the path to your copy of the  [content repository](https://github.com/jimthoburn/picture-gallery). You can use the account and key you created in steps 3 and 4 for the other environment variables and secrets. For the `known_hosts` secret file, you can add GitHub‚Äôs [SSH key entries](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/githubs-ssh-key-fingerprints).
6. In your Render dashboard, create a new [blueprint](https://render.com/docs/infrastructure-as-code) using your copy of this repository. A new service will be set up for you automatically.
7. Link the environment group you created in step 4 to your new service, and then re-deploy your new service.

## Image file storage

[Git Large File Storage](https://git-lfs.github.com/) is configured for the service. This will support using `git-lfs` if it‚Äôs also enabled in your [content repository](https://github.com/jimthoburn/picture-gallery). If you have a lot of image files, you may run into [bandwidth limits on GitHub](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/working-with-files/managing-large-files/about-storage-and-bandwidth-usage) when deploying the service.

## Project goals

This project is an experiment to see how easily the following goals can be achieved when deploying a static site‚Ä¶

1. Support a large amount of images during the build step for a static site (more than 10 GB).
2. Host the images using [GitHub‚Äôs Large File Storage](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/working-with-files/managing-large-files/about-git-large-file-storage), so that they can be easily cloned from a private repository or downloaded from a public repository.
3. Use [Deno](https://deno.com) to build the site, to make local development and deployment more secure.
